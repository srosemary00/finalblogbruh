Hey! Okay so, my name is Smita Rosemary. I'm a senior in EBHS, who's about to graduate in like 4 days woohoo!!!
I have a brother who also recently graduated (but he graduated college haha). And also, I'll be attending Northeastern University next year, which tbh, I'm really excited for!! I cannot wait to explore Boston with my friends and cousins.

Social Media information: I have multiple different social media pages from Insta, to tiktok, to Twitter. They almost all follow the same username "smiths_rose".

Brag Sheet: I'm a senior so no need :)
